Hi, I'm James Fisher. I'm an aspiring geospatial software developer with interests in leveraging satellite and UAS (drone) data for risk modeling, surface hydrology, and remote sensing applications. 
Please check back frequently as I build out this GitHub page with a variety of GIS and image processing software. 

Thank you for visiting!
